# Credit_Risk_Prediction
 Developed a machine learning model to predict credit risk using various classification algorithms, including Support Vector
 Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient
 Boosting, and XGBoost. The project involved handling an imbalanced dataset, performing feature engineering, and evaluating
 the performance of each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores. The goal was to identify high-risk
 customers and optimize loan approval processes for financial institutions.
